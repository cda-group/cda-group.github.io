# Arc-script

### Highlights

[Arc-Script](https://github.com/cda-group/arc/arc-script) is a high-level programming language for continuous and deep analytics.
[Arc-MLIR](https://github.com/cda-group/arc/arc-mlir) is an optimizable intermediate representation which Arc-Script compiles to.

### Why use Arc-Script?

* Arc-Script is **fun** to write code in, easy to learn and is designed for great readability.
* Arc-Script is **integrated** with IDEs through the language server protocol and web-editors through WebAssembly.
* Arc-Script is **productive**. Developers can write and reuse Arc-Script modules for different applications with overlapping requirements.
* Arc-script is **extensible** by allowing integration with external Rust libraries.
* Arc-Script is **real-time** by being able to express arbitrary streaming computation through asynchronous functions.
* Arc-Script is **fast** by being compiled to native Rust and optimized by [MLIR](http://mlir.llvm.org) to execute on the Arcon runtime.
